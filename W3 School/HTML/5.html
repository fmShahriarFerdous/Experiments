        <p id="blockqt"><blockquote cite="https://www.google.com">One of the most powerful political poems of the 20th century was written by a man who was ambivalent about politics. William Butler Yeats (1865–1939) began his career under the spell of the late Victorian era. <q>Art in that time was generally more romantic than worldly</q>. The word spell is relevant here: in 1887, Yeats became a Theosophist and an acolyte of Russian occultist Madame Blavatsky. <!--He participated--> in various spiritualist practices—from séances to automatic writing—for the rest of his life.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="citee"><cite>In middle age, Yeats became disillusioned, or perhaps more attuned to certain realities. As Virginia Woolf pointed out, “human character changed”</cite></p>
